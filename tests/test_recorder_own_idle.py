"""RX_VK_RECORDER=thread's two opt-in switches, RX_VK_RECORDER_OWN and RX_VK_RECORDER_IDLE=wait. No game, no GPU, no Vulkan library.

python -I -B tests/test_recorder_own_idle.py --headers <Vulkan-Headers/include> [--cxx clang++]

1. The sources: rec::OwnSlot marks the slot's own calls in vk_replay.cpp's begin_recording and vk_draw.cpp's draw_begin_recording
   and nowhere else (the frame's command buffer, ImGui, NGX and FSR keep their waits); begin_recording calls slot_begin() before
   them and slot_done() after draw_begin_recording; submit_recording keeps the slot's end position after its two ends. Controls: an
   OwnSlot in another function, and slot_begin() after the OwnSlot, are found.
2. tests/recorder_own_idle_test.cpp, built with the real vk_work.h and vk_recorder.h and a fake Vulkan, the recorder thread held in
   a gated packet (no timing: a 3 s watchdog turns a wrong wait into a failure):
   - the switches read as the renderer reads them, and named in the recorder's log line;
   - RX_VK_RECORDER_OWN=1: the slot's descriptor pool reset within OwnSlot reaches the driver while a packet is in flight; a call
     that is not the slot's own (vkEndCommandBuffer) within it, the reset outside it, the switch off (unset or 0), and a slot whose
     last end the recorder has not run (the guard, logged once) all wait for the packet;
   - RX_VK_RECORDER_IDLE: unset, WaitOnAddress is never called; =wait without the functions, turned off and logged at the start;
     the recorder waiting on W is woken by a publish; a publish between sleeping set and the wait (the wake made to do nothing)
     makes the wait return at once on the changed W;
   - own_slots: two slots with their own command pools, command buffers, descriptor pools, extra pools and sets; slot 1's binds held
     in the recorder while slot 0 comes round, its GPU work completing late: slot 0's own calls reach the driver while slot 1's
     packets are held, and the fakes, which know which object each held packet names, find no reset, begin or destruction of an
     object in use and no slot reused before its GPU work completed. _wrong (slot 1's pool reset) and _early (slot 0 reused before
     its GPU work completed) show the fakes catch each;
   - real_ (Windows; skipped elsewhere): vk_replay.cpp's own WaitOnAddress adapter (rec_wait_hooks, cut from the source): a publish
     wakes the recorder asleep on W; with no wake the 2 ms timeout brings it back; a publish just before the wait with the wake off;
     stop while asleep; both switches together. Each ends with vkDestroyDevice's teardown (the recorder stopped and joined) and a
     normal return.
3. The test has teeth: vk_recorder.h with vkEndCommandBuffer among the slot's own calls, the guard removed, the switch ignored,
   OwnSlot ignoring slot_begin(), the wait's compare taken from W instead of the r it last saw, the wake removed, or (Windows) the
   wait's timeout taken out, must fail it; so must (Windows) vk_replay.cpp's adapter with a wake that does nothing or a wait that
   compares against W as it is now (the real_parked and real_race waits get a 10 s timeout, so within the 3 s a case allows
   only the wake or the compare ends them), and the source check with recording_wait commented out or another slot's
   descriptor pools.
