"""Check that a submission cut into parts (RX_VK_CHUNK, vk_replay.cpp maybe_split) can end a part only right before a plain
draw (no game/GPU required): maybe_split asks for the end (part_end_wanted) and replay() makes it (split_part) before a
NOP_DRAW, NOP_DRAW_IDX or NOP_DRAW_INDIRECT that will be recorded, so no cut leaves a part beginning with a mesh draw or a dispatch. On an
Intel Arc B580 a command buffer that began with mesh draws drew the plain draws after them as exploded triangles (white
shards while moving). RX_VK_SPLIT_BEFORE_DRAW=0 ends a part after its 120th draw or dispatch, as before.
