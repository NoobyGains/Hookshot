"""On Intel's one-at-a-time compute builds a dispatch's pipeline is made first without the optimizer, then with it.

A UHD Graphics (i3-1115G4, 2 cores, 4 threads, 16 GB shared) took 0.3 s to 6.5 min with the optimizer for each of 37 of the
game's dispatches, 22 minutes on the one serial thread, and every pass over the scene (its light, its exposure) was left
out until its turn: the Deku Tree's dialogue drawn blown out. The first build is made without the optimizer; the optimized
one is queued behind the builds asked for first and bound once made, the first kept for the session. The Debug tab's Intel
quick compute builds row (Intel graphics on Windows, as the Intel shader compiles row), or RX_VK_COMPUTE_QUICK_FIRST over
it, turns that off. The same tab's Set up for a weak laptop button (integrated graphics) sets that laptop's rows at once.
