"""The BC3 scratch has the layers a run uses, not more (gpu/vk/vk_texture.cpp; no game or GPU needed).

Decoded ASTC is encoded to BC3 through a 2048 x 2048 scratch image and its output buffer, kept once made. A run is one layer
(RX_VK_BC_LAYERS=<n>: up to 8), but the scratch was made with 8 layers whatever the runs used: 160 MB held, 20 of them ever
written. The scratch, the second one and both users (an upload's runs, a copy into a BC3 texture) now ask bc_layers().

The two loops that fill it are also run, cut out of the source into tests/bc_scratch_batches_test.cpp with a spy in place
of Vulkan: no run is larger than the scratch, each starts at its first layer, and a request larger than the scratch (a
copy of 9 layers, an array's dirty layers with gaps) comes out whole and in order as several runs.
