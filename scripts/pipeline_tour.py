"""The pipeline tour: plays the game unattended, from a new save through every debug Teleport destination as child and as
adult, with the items, their effects and the menus, so that its graphics pipelines are met and written to the pipeline state list
(gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp: hookshot_pipeline_states.bin). The parts' lists become the tour's source of the list a release ships,
assets/pipeline_states/tour.bin.xz and tour.md (nx2/pipeline_states.py tour): the first start prepares those pipelines before the
title.

Ported from Hookshot's draft pull request #2048 (upstream, now deleted) by HumanBean (hckrman101 on GitHub), and changed to drive the
game through the control bridge (host/control.c, docs/control.md) instead of a live input file and the log.

    python -I scripts/pipeline_tour.py tour --game <game folder> --out <dir> [--name play] [--parts ...] [--publish] [--env ...] [--ini ...]
    python -I scripts/pipeline_tour.py run  --game <game folder> --out <dir> [--name play] [--part <part>] [--first <stop>] [--stops N]
                                            [--skip-opening] [--env NAME=VALUE ...] [--ini key=value ...] [--window WxH] [--dry-run]
    python -I scripts/pipeline_tour.py merge --out <file> <list> ...
    python -I scripts/pipeline_tour.py report <out>/<name>
    python -I scripts/pipeline_tour.py value <run dir> ... [--sub] [--floor 10]

run: one game. The game folder is used as it is, so give it a copy (cp -a --reflink=always): its hookshot_pipelines.bin (the pipeline
notes), hookshot_pipeline_states.bin and hookshot_pipeline_states_shipped.bin are moved aside for the run (a precompiled pipeline is
not noted again, and only what this run meets counts) and put back after it. The run starts with no save at all (an empty data folder
of its own, <out>/<name>/data): the title, New Game, the opening, then control of Link. Then every item, and each destination: the
teleport, its loading, the camera all around, at a few the sword, the shield and an item from the pause menu, until no new pipeline
came for a while.

The game is driven through the control bridge (HOS_CONTROL, a socket in the run's folder): presses timed in the game's frames
(sequence), the debug teleport by destination and the age switch with the game's own answer (refused, cancelled, sent; then the map
it arrives in), and the game's state (the map, an event playing, a map loading, Link's age: status). The one thing the bridge does
not do, the Debug tab's inventory, goes through the live input file (HOS_INPUT_LIVE, "!cheat <action>"). No controller is opened
(HOS_NO_SDL) and nothing reaches the desktop. As fast as the game goes: no window (HOS_HEADLESS), the smallest output (640x360, the
game's own upscaler at 50%: a pipeline's key has formats and state, not sizes), frame pacing off, no frame generation, the cap
Uncapped with every frame a 60th of a second of game time (HOS_FPS_MAX=1000, HOS_FPS_STEP=0), text at once, and the opening skipped
by the game itself (HOS_SKIP_OPENING) in every part but the one that watches it. Each step has a limit: a step that does not happen
fails the run, it does not wander. --env and --ini run it under other settings (RX_VK_FORCE_MESH_FALLBACK=1, dlss=0, hdr=1,
HOS_HANDHELD=1); the options file is restored. --window shows it in a window instead.

tour: the parts one after another, one game at a time, in a reflinked copy of the game folder, in games of --chunk stops (a
fresh game each), at nice 19 on --cpus, each under the memory guard (MEM: it waits for memory before a game, and ends a game that
holds too much or leaves the machine too little, the next game going on from there; on Linux the game runs in a systemd scope
with a MemoryMax); merged; --publish writes the repository's tour list from them (nx2/pipeline_states.py tour, with the GPU,
build, settings and route the runs logged).

value: each step's pipelines over runs that the players' lists (the shipped list's contrib/ sources) and the other steps do not
have, its seconds, and which steps add too little to keep.

Each run writes <out>/<name>/: states.bin (its list), report.txt and report.json (the pipelines after each step, the new ones each
added, its frames and wall time), log.txt (the game's log) and steps.txt (what was sent, at which frame).

Linux (the memory guard reads /proc; the bridge is a Unix socket). Standard library only. The actions' numbers come from
host/hos_main.c, gpu/vk/oot_cheat_items.h and gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp; the bridge's client is scripts/hookshot_ctl.py.
